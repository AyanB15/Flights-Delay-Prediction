# Flights-Delay-Prediction

This projects helps in predicting flight delays using machine learning techniques. We employ feature engineering and machine learning classification algorithms to enhance accuracy and precision. There are two datasets - 
1. Flight_History.csv 
2. Flights_Test.csv


Implemented on VsCode using python below libraries - 
  matplotlib
  scikit-learn
  numpy
  pandas
